 * Toast notifications are used to notify users of a system occurrence. Toast notifications should be transient and stay
 * on the screen for 8 seconds, so that they do not block the information behind them for too long, but allows the user
 * to read the message. The ToastNotification component allows status, header, message, primary action and menu actions
 * for the notification. The notification can also allow the user to close the notification.
 *
 * Note: Using the kebab menu (more actions) with the close button is not currently supported. If both are specified the
 * close button will not be shown. Add a close menu item if you want to have both capabilities.
